The Health Discernment System is a CNN-based classification model designed to detect and diagnose Malaria, Dengue, and Breast Cancer from medical images. This AI-powered system aims to assist healthcare professionals in making fast, accurate, and reliable diagnoses, ultimately improving early detection and patient outcomes.
The CNN model is trained on publicly available medical image datasets, including:

Malaria Detection – Cell images dataset with Parasitized vs. Uninfected samples.
Dengue Detection – Blood smear images dataset.
Breast Cancer Detection – Histopathological image dataset with Benign vs. Malignant cases.
